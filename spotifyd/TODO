## Todo

1. Update reqwest

	I've had to roll back reqwest to version 0.9.3 because the one linked
	(0.9.9) against spotifyd 0.2.5 won't build with the version of Rust I have
	(1.29.1) and I can't (be bothered) to build rust from source (it's bad enough
	building this project) so I'll have to settle for the binary I have until there
	is a more recent one available in pkgsrc (it seems to have disappeared
	temporarily). The issue that I hit is:

		access to extern crates through prelude is experimental (see issue #44660)

	0.9.6 introduced this with: <https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/commit/4c21127f15ff814f8397a336fd647edc7cc89bc8>

2. In the Makefile there is this todo item:

		# TODO investigate why this is needed
		CHECK_WRKREF_SKIP+=	bin/spotifyd


## Done

1. Need to somewhat manually create patches. mkpatches doesn't pick up changes
from vendor directory. E.g, do `pkgdiff` in the directory and then edit patch
to reference correct location like:

		../vendor/daemonize-0.2.3/src/ffi.rs

2. Figure out why it can't find OpenSSL. Building _normally_ works fine, so
something to do with pkgsrc. Maybe need to set a variable somewhere.

		error: failed to run custom build command for `openssl-sys v0.9.39`
		process didn't exit successfully: `/usr/pkgsrc/wip/spotifyd/work/spotifyd-0.2.3/target/release/build/openssl-sys-db8d42dae8a7dcaf/build-script-main` (exit code: 101)

		Could not find directory of OpenSSL installation, and this `-sys` crate cannot
		proceed without this knowledge. If OpenSSL is installed and this crate had
		trouble finding it,  you can set the `OPENSSL_DIR` environment variable for the
		compilation process.

		Make sure you also have the development packages of openssl installed.
		For example, `libssl-dev` on Ubuntu or `openssl-devel` on Fedora.

		If you're in a situation where you think the directory *should* be found
		automatically, please open a bug at https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl
		and include information about your system as well as this message.

		    $HOST = x86_64-unknown-netbsd
		    $TARGET = x86_64-unknown-netbsd
		    openssl-sys = 0.9.39

	Needed to set these:

		MAKE_ENV+= OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/openssl
		MAKE_ENV+= OPENSSL_LIB_DIR=/usr/lib

	Actually though I probably need to copy what tealdeer does with openssl

3. In updating to spotifyd 0.2.5 ran into some issues with nix and libc

		 error[E0425]: cannot find function `fexecve` in module `libc`
		   --> /usr/pkgsrc/wip/spotifyd/work/vendor/nix-0.11.0/src/unistd.rs:655:15
		    |
		655 |         libc::fexecve(fd, args_p.as_ptr(), env_p.as_ptr())
		    |               ^^^^^^^ did you mean `execve`?
		help: possible candidate is found in another module, you can import it into scope
		    |
		3   | use unistd::fexecve;
		    |

		error: aborting due to previous error

		For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0425`.
		error: Could not compile `nix`.
		warning: build failed, waiting for other jobs to finish...
		error: build failed
		*** Error code 101

	The relevant PRs for this are:

		- https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/pull/1000
		- https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/pull/1201

	In a nutshell the problem is that libc was updated to remove `fexecve`
	for netbsd-like platforms as it's irrelevant, but spotifyd has dependencies on
	older versions of nix that still look for this function so we need to patch one
	of these older versions to remove this function. Rust dependency management is
	obviously not solving _all_ the problems although it is nice (I think?) how you
	can be dependent on multiple versions of the same thing.
